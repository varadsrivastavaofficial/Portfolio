- Footer Disclaimer: A clear footer stating the personal portfolio nature and disclaimers regarding the financial information displayed. Logo is included at top-left.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Metallic gold (#D4AF37), used sparingly for CTAs, active states, headings, and hover highlights. Rooted in the user's specification of gold and black for the theme, this color lends an air of luxury.
- Background color: Deep charcoal (#121212), provides a dark, cinematic backdrop, allowing the gold accents to pop. Echoes the requested deep black / charcoal color scheme.
- Accent color: Warm gray (#A9A9A9) for body text, offering sufficient contrast against the dark background while maintaining a professional and readable feel.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif with an elegant, high-end feel; matches the user's request for an elegant serif or premium display font.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a clean sans-serif for excellent readability, requested by the user.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Generous use of spacing and padding to ensure content is easy to scan. Grid-based layout is adapted to create a professional experience for the visitor.
- Subtle reveal animations on section scroll to enhance user engagement without sacrificing performance.
- Incorporate a custom-designed logo that is placed strategically on the page.
